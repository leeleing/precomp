# precomp - a python code developed to provide span-variant structural properties for composite blades.
PreComp computes these properties with a novel approach that integrates a modified classic laminate theory with a shear-flow approach.  The computed properties include cross-coupled stiffness properties, inertia properties, and offsets of the blade shear center, tension center, and center of mass with respect to the blade pitch axis.  Analysts need these properties to properly model the major flexible components of a wind turbineâ€”blades, tower, and drivetrain shaft.  Almost every aeroelastic code (FAST, ADAMS, BLADED, etc.) requires these properties as inputs.  Designers need these properties to rapidly evaluate alternate composite layouts and their effects on blade properties and material strains.  Structural properties are difficult to extract from 3-D finite element models (FEMs), which are primarily suited to obtaining detailed stress and displacement distributions.  Such models also take time and effort to develop and are typically used during the final design stage.
